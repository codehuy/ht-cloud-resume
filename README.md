In the world of tech, showcasing your skills is crucial, and what better way to demonstrate your expertise than by taking on the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge? This challenge has gained immense popularity among aspiring cloud engineers and developers, offering an opportunity to build and deploy a resume website using various AWS services. In this blog post, I'll walk you through my experience with the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge, detailing the steps I took to create a dynamic resume website hosted entirely on AWS.

# Getting Started
The first step in tackling the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge is to design and develop your resume website. For this project, I chose to utilize HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to craft a visually appealing and interactive resume. Once the website was ready, it was time to bring it to life using AWS services.

# Leveraging AWS Services

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) served as the foundation for hosting my resume website. I uploaded the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files to an S3 bucket, making them accessible to users over the internet.

Route 53, AWS's scalable DNS web service, enabled me to register a domain name for my resume website. This allowed users to access my resume using a custom domain, adding a professional touch to the project.

To enhance the performance and security of my resume website, I leveraged Amazon CloudFront, AWS's content delivery network (CDN). CloudFront cached my website's content at edge locations worldwide, ensuring fast and reliable access for users across the globe.

For dynamic content on my resume website, such as visitor count and feedback submissions, I integrated Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service. DynamoDB stored and retrieved data seamlessly, adding interactivity to the static resume website.

To handle backend logic and dynamic content generation, I utilized AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service. I wrote Lambda functions in Node.js to interact with DynamoDB, process form submissions, and perform other backend tasks, ensuring smooth functionality of the resume website.

# Automating Deployment with GitHub Actions
Maintaining and updating the resume website was made effortless thanks to GitHub Actions. I set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions, allowing changes pushed to the GitHub repository to automatically trigger deployment to AWS services. This streamlined the development process and ensured that the resume website was always up-to-date.

# Securing with OpenID
Security was a top priority throughout the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge. To safeguard sensitive data and restrict access to authorized users, I implemented OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication. By integrating OIDC with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), I enforced secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, protecting both the website and its backend resources from unauthorized access.

# Conclusion
The AWS Cloud Resume Challenge provided a hands-on opportunity to showcase my skills in cloud computing and web development. By leveraging various AWS services and best practices, I successfully built and deployed a dynamic resume website that not only highlights my professional achievements but also demonstrates my proficiency in cloud technologies.
